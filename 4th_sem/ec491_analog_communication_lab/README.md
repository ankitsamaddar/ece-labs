# EC491 Analog Communication Lab

This repository contains MATLAB code files for the EC491 Analog Communication Lab.

## Files

- [AM.m](AM.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for Amplitude Modulation (AM).
- [comlabP1.m](comlabP1.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for performing experiments related to the Amplitude Modulation (AM) technique.
- [comlabP2.m](comlabP2.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for performing experiments related to the Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) technique.
- [comlabP3.m](comlabP3.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for performing experiments related to the Frequency Modulation (FM) technique.
- [DSB_SC.m](DSB_SC.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) modulation.
- [FINAL.m](FINAL.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for performing experiments related to the Amplitude Modulation (AM), Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC), and Frequency Modulation (FM) techniques.
- [FM.m](FM.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for Frequency Modulation (FM).
- [SSB_SC.m](SSB_SC.m): This file contains the MATLAB code for Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) modulation.

Each file contains a MATLAB code that implements a particular modulation technique, and the corresponding experiment. The codes are self-explanatory, and comments have been added to the files wherever necessary.

## Usage

To use the code files, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. Simply navigate to the file you wish to use and open it in MATLAB. The code is ready to be run.
