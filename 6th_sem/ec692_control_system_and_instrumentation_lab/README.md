## Usage

- To run these programs, MATLAB should be installed on your system.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the cloned repository is located.
- Open the program file you want to run and click on the "Run" button or type "" in the command window.
- The program will execute and the output will be displayed in the MATLAB console and/or plots.

For more information on each experiment and its corresponding MATLAB file or Simulink model, please refer to the lab manual or course materials.
