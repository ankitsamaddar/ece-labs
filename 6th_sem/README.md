# 6th_sem

This repository contains the lab work and mini project for the 6th semester of the Electronics and Communication Engineering course. The following folders are included in this repository:

- [ec691_computer_network_lab](ec691_computer_network_lab): This folder contains lab work related to computer networks. It includes experiments on arithmetic and binary operations, bit framing and plotting, bit stuffing, CRC algorithm, and checksum algorithm.

- [ec692_control_system_and_instrumentation_lab](ec692_control_system_and_instrumentation_lab): This folder contains lab work related to control systems and instrumentation. It includes experiments on response of a damped system, maximum peak overshoot, response type I and type II, Nyquist plot, and root locus poles.

- [ec693_mini_project_electronic_design_workshop](ec693_mini_project_electronic_design_workshop): This folder contains the mini project for the electronic product design workshop. The project is focused on electronic circuit design and should cater to a small system required in laboratory or real life. It may be a complete hardware or a combination of hardware and software, with the software part being less than 50% of the total work. The project should encompass components, devices, analog or digital ICs, microcontroller with which functional familiarity is introduced.

Please refer to the individual folders for more information on the lab works and mini project.
