# EC693 Mini Project/ Electronic Design Workshop

## [Project Repository](https://github.com/ankitsamaddar/ece_project_1## )

## Overview

This is a repository for electronic product design work with a focus on electronic circuit design. The mini project is a combination of hardware and software, where the software part should be less than 50% of the total work. The aim of this project is to cater to a small system required in laboratory or real life, and encompass components, devices, analog or digital ICs, microcontroller with which functional familiarity is introduced.
