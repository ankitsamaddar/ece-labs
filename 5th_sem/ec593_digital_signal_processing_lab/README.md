# ec593 Digital Signal Processing Lab

This repository contains MATLAB programs for the Digital Signal Processing lab (ec593) course. 

## MATLAB Programs

- [exp1_unit_signals.m](exp1_unit_signals.m): This program generates the unit impulse, step and ramp signals and plots them on the same graph.

- [exp2_operations_on_signals.m](exp2_operations_on_signals.m): This program performs various operations on two input signals, such as addition, multiplication, and convolution. It also plots the input and output signals.

- [exp3_convolution_signals.m](exp3_convolution_signals.m): This program computes the convolution of two signals using both the built-in MATLAB function and manual implementation. It plots the input and output signals.

- [exp4_commutative_conv.m](exp4_commutative_conv.m): This program demonstrates the commutativity property of convolution. It computes the convolution of two signals in both orders and compares the results.

- [exp5_associative_distributive_conv.m](exp5_associative_distributive_conv.m): This program demonstrates the associative and distributive properties of convolution. It computes the convolution of three signals using different order of operations and compares the results.

## Running the Programs

- To run these programs, MATLAB should be installed on your system.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the cloned repository is located.
- Open the program file you want to run and click on the "Run" button or type "<filename>" in the command window.
- The program will execute and the output will be displayed in the MATLAB console and/or plots.

## Credits

This lab is a part of the Digital Signal Processing course at MAKAUT. The programs in this repository were created by *ANKIT SAMADDAR* as a part of the lab coursework.
